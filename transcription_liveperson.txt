Yes, I can hear you.
Can you hear me? Yeah. Okay, good. Nice to meet you.
. .
Yes, of course.
We have about an hour for the interview of Prince.
or engineer that I'm looking for my group.
So, yeah, let me first introduce myself.
And then I would be happy to hear your career journey, what you're doing.
for what you did so far hmm okay so
So yeah, so I'm the hiring manager, by the way, for my group.
My name is Orly. I am managing the group.
of workspaces, which is responsive.
responsible for the orchestration.
of the UI of all of the micro front-end architecture.
with the UI modules for the various themes.
front-end teams in LivePerson. I also have a team.
that owns the agent workspace, which is.
the workspace for the agents.
that will write all the messages.
manage their conversations. So yeah, I will get
to that in a minute. Just a bit about LivePerson. Are you familiar with LivePerson?
Yeah. Okay. Good.
So it's part of being a messaging platform.
then this is like the agent workspace where all of the agents are sending the messages.
And I also have a mobile application.
that is like a light version of the Asian workspace.
It was rewritten lately with...
the React Native, so this is like an object.
available up on Google Play Store and Apple.
And then play store?
What else? Yeah, and I'm looking for...
a principal engineer to join the group.
um, to help me.
uh, take this, uh, um,
design architecture for the next level.
um yeah i'm a bit about myself i'm
in life person for three and a half years.
20 years in the industry, I'm located in Israel, I
have teams, like it is a global, we
company so we are working with people around the world.
For my group, we have teams in Berlin, Bulgaria.
Syria, Israel, work from India, yeah.
So, yes.
Bye-bye.
Yes, it is. Yes.

.
.
.
Thank you.
. .
. .
. .
. .
. .
. .
Yes, yes, so let's just start.
walk through your career journey.
Um, so today, like you are in.
in payrails and sort of life.
like how many engineers do you have there?
Thank you.
Yeah, so comparing to, I don't know,
Trivago I assume it is like in it is smaller, right?
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
because like on your resume you are describing like 200
front and develop large-scale and and I think like
This is something that is more similar to what is happening in life.
person from front-end perspective and large-scale
like millions of messages a day.
And what are you looking for?
. .
. .
. .
.
. .
. .
.
. .
. .
So like. So what are you looking for next, like?
. .
. .
.
. .
.
You got it.
. .
.
. .
Got it. By the way, the technological stuff like the
language that we are using is Vue, Vue 3 today.
But most teams are like we migrated from view.
take Vue.js, Vue 2.0, like the code is...
using JavaScript, less TypeScript.
And you know how it is, like the code is there, we are not.
We don't have capacity to migrate it to TypeScript, but yeah.
Yeah, only that new code we will work.
with TypeScript when we will prepare.
the infrastructure for it like from store perspective and so on.
So, yes, so let's let's talk about
about like what you did with, with, like, I mean,
interested to hear about the micro front and architecture and was working.
there, if you can describe like.
What is the product in Delivery Hero?
And like, what was your role? Like, what?
Your day to day, how did you got your task or?
did you like, you know, as as principal, as staff in
engineer, how did you create? OK.
What am I going to work on, on the next two weeks and so on, or, or even.
long-term.
.
Thank you. Bye-bye.
.
Bye-bye.
. .
. .
.
. .
. .
. .
Thank you. Thank you.
.
. .
Thank you.
. .
. .
. .
. .
you
Bye-bye.
What is the product in Hero?
What is the product?
Just for the context.
.
. .
. .
Thank you.
Thank you.
. .
. .
. .
Thank you.
Thank you.
.
.
. .
.
.
. .
.
. .
.
Bye. Bye.
this is like from technical perspective, like from product wise, business wise.
what was the goal of the company.
Okay.
. .
. .
.
.
Thank you.
.
. .
. .
. .
So, so you, you were on the team.
team that was responsible for the infrastructure of
of the product, like the shared life.
libraries, the store management, I don't know.
know, log in all of all of that was managed by your team.
or by your medicine.
. .
. .
Okay, got it and like I'm I am a team doing
specific page, how do I connect to the system like that?
how everything is orchestrated, I think.
. .
. .
. .
. .
. .
. .
.
.
. .
. .
. .
. .
Okay.
. .
. .
. .
. .
. .
.
Okay.
Okay.
So everything is in one monorepo. Yeah.
and I separated by folders.
. .
So, if I need to navigate...
to the next tab in your application, then.
You have the config file that will send me the route of or the folder
that I need to look at and then I will get I will go to this.
logic on this folder and everything will be served there.
there, but like from session management statement.
management, everything is managed as one, right? Everything.
but you inject it to the ... to the specific part.
uh, application, I will go. So it's like
So you don't, when application is loaded.
yeah what is happening when it is loaded so I am now
on the main page, everything now loads, what happens when it starts?
. .
Yeah, yeah
. .
. .
. .
. .
. .
. .
You
. .
Yeah, I guess because like in...
in the conversational cloud, the product that is.
the micro front and main product so this is
responsible for the frame, for the patient on the.
for the login, for the session management, for the store.
And if I'm a module that I have like.
If you click on this option on the navigation.
menu then it will have some
config that will tell, oh, this is the project, this is the module.
then it will go to this module and it has...
like separated packages, um, like
like all of the assets and the builds are per project.
module and then it will orchestrate everything it will also not show
you or not load packages that the agent doesn't.
have permissions, so I will, so for, for performance.
if we will talk about the next session, the next topic.
uh for you is like did you encounter performance
performance problems or how did you measure performance from low
like forced content paint, did you have...
have metrics for that or on what suppose or what.
do you, if it is, um, if you're a
Customers are suffering from latency, for example, how did you know...
that or if you had some project to improve performance.
Like, I don't know.
Bye-bye.
. .
. .
Thank you.
. .
Bye-bye.
Thank you.
Bye-bye.
. .
Thank you.
. .
. .
Thank you.
. .
Thank you. Bye-bye.
. .
. .
. .
.
. .
. .
. .
.
Yeah. It's positive.
Yeah, it doesn't sound the same, like, like.
Like each repo that you're running,
um, is sort of independent and you should inject.
from the upper layer all the information like I don't know if you need.
the JWT, if you need all of that.
then you will take it from the upper layer, but your module should be.
behave independent and if I understand correctly, like it.
is highly coupled in your application, right?
Thank you.
.
.
. .
. .
. .
.
. .
Okay.
Got it. So now looking back.
At what you did there, do you think you would change the architecture?
Yes, what would you do different?
.
. .
. .
Thank you.
. .
Bye-bye.
. .
Bye-bye.
you
.
.
. .
Thank you.
. .
. .
. .
. .
Bye-bye.
.
. .
. .
. .
. .
. .
. .
. .
. .
. .
. .
.
. .
Yeah. Thanks. Bye. Bye.
. .
. .
Thank you.
. .
Got it.
And, um, like from production perspective or deployment perspective, how.
How did that work, like how was it done?
on public cloud and like.
I'm working on your monorepo. I'm from this team. I committed my.
change, what's next, how did it reach production and...
How did you deploy to production and later on if you got in.
How did you debug the incident on production?
Thank you.
. .
.
. .
Thank you.
. .
Thank you. Thank you.
. .
. .
.
Bye-bye.
. .
. .
So when I build my changes, it builds the entire projects, all of them.
the pool.
My project.
. .
. .
. .
. .
. .
. .
.
. .
. .
You
. .
. .
. .
. .
.
. .
. .
.
Wait, wait, before, before the incident, just to unmute.
understand. Yeah, because we have like discussions on how.
to deploy to production, so this is why I'm asking.
So, I need, I did production, everything is good.
I tested. Now I said, okay, I want to take this to production.
So, I run build-fraud.
Then, is it manual?
or is it like we give up actions and we'll deploy it?
Um, um, with Jenkins or whatever.
it is deploying the package and uploads everything, all of the packages.
packages are now redeployed to production, is this how it works?
. .
. .
Just for one minute, OK, this one.
One second.
you
you
you
Sorry.
It was my kid, finished school.
Okay, so, so I finished, uh, like
I run the build on production, what happens then?
. .
.
.
.
Okay.
You
Got it. But
What is the landing page, like is it a different application?
Where did you build this landing?
. .
. .
. .
you
. .
. .
Okay. We are. Thank you. Bye.
Yes, I think so. I think so. So, so like everything is on.
side rendering and on the front end you will have all of the
of those static files and you can select it.
each of your modules.
different builds and then you will create like a snapshot.
of it, and then you will say, this is what I want on production.
Bye.
. .
Oh, it's per country.
You
Hi, parajinguitos all. Tony Hi Father Hi Hi Hello Low Father Come on in. Ni√±o Hello Hello Montague entirely all Son Hi Governor Hello What's your name? My name? Yes
That was your A, B testing, like first you started small.
. .
. .
. .
Which tool were you using for Fidget Flutter?
Bye-bye.
Uh Once darkly
. .
Yeah.
Got it. Got it. Okay. I'm just 10.
And then last question, like how did you debug?
Like if you found some incident, some incident was reported on production.
How did you debug it?
Bye.
Bye-bye.
Thank you.
All right. Okay.
. .
Thank you.
Bye. Bye. Bye.
Thank you.
. .
So you couldn't actually.
debug production, like if you had an issue in production.
couldn't debug it, like to see on your browser what is happening.
like I could see my cord, I could put breakpoint.
on the browser and view my code, you couldn't do that.
do that.
Thank you.
. .
Can you find like?
When you deployed the code, was it minified?
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.
.
Okay, but you were like
debugging locally, not production.
Thank you.
Thank you.
. .
. .
Yes.
Yes, but there also there's an option to do that on production
with your source code.
Yes.
We're doing it with Puppeteer. Injecting.
our specific module code.
that it would listen to your local host.
with whatever port you are running and then for this specific
module, it will inject your source code.
source build and not production. So it's nice. Very helpful.
Thank you. Bye-bye.
with playwright you can do that also but yeah we we first use it with before we
We had playwrights, so in-house tool that we built.
pretty cool. You can debug production. I was thinking to load it to GitHub.
hub to the community. So everyone can use that. It can be very
helpful. Anyway, yeah, I sort of understand.
and um like how you were working and and like from your
perspective, Mustafa, like, um, like,
How what is your day-to-day like OK, so you have the VJ.
you have a yearly vision, OKRs and so on, but eventually.
Like you were working with the teams right like you had a lot
lot of teams there and micro front end or front end teams.
front and teams and you were on the
infrastructure, I guess, team.
and how did you know what to do next?
Yes.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.
. .
. .
. .
. .
Thank you.
. .
Bye.
. .
. .
we end
Which part did you like most, the coding stuff or the...
the planning.
Yes, so you will always go find it.
yourself some project code.
. .
Okay, um, what about
back-end like all of that was on front-end or you also did the
Service site
. .
. .
Thank you.
. .
Thank you.
. .
Okay.
Okay.
Any questions?
to me.
. .
. .
Thank you. Bye bye.
So, there's the like routine.
day-to-day job of the of the teams we have.
We have the objectives, we have the roadmap, we know what projects we need.
to finish, we need, we have backbone marionette component.
that we must rewrite.
because of security and there are a lot of
things that we're doing, like we're now migrating to GCP, so we have backend.
services that we need to migrate and all of.
the features and bugs and incidents and performance improvements.
and so on, so we have the task for the team. But for the.
In principle, the expectation is to look vertical.
on the activities and to think...
on the next level, where are we taking?
the teams or you know if it is a specific problem.
for for one of the teams, one of the
of the developers, there's like brainstorming needed, design, new...
architecture then of course principle should be there and help.
with the design and architecture.
So you have the ongoing stuff, but you also need to have.
to be proactive with, okay, what we have today.
what we need to change, how everything
is working together and maybe we needed to fix it. Maybe it's not working right.
Looking at performance, okay, we can do better on performance.
if we would do XYZ. Today, we're
working with Vuex as the store management of.
Vue, Vuex is end of life. We need to replace that.
uh with pina store i don't know if you are familiar with you uh
Uhm? But OK, so how do?
We do that by not enforcing all of our...
15 modules to do so, like I want to do.
to do it gradually, I wanted to co-exist Vuex and Pinnia.
Yes, so I would want to have this project running on the principle.
engineer and and then to embed the raw
load for everyone else for all of the teams. So this.
This is what I'm looking for. I'm looking for someone assertive, proactive.
Strong coding skills.
and having a vision of how
things should work, how we can improve.
This is the thing that I'm looking for.
Yes, it is.
So she's like strong.
strong candidate for a very mean
meaningful role.
How do you see that?
. .
Yes.
Bye-bye.
Okay, no surprises, yes.
Okay, what else?
Thank you. Thank you.
. .
. .
And of course, that.
Thank you.
Yes, so don't forget that we do have team leads.
and teams are
First of all yes on boarding of course like three months on boarding
and understanding what is going on but next thing would be okay
... Let's take this, this piece, okay, this product.
this project, this topic, and let's work on that.
Depends on our objectives for this year, depends on the vision, okay.
we have now on our objectives to re-regulate the system.
right or to get rid of all of the backbone marionette components.
opponents, then I would want the involvement of principal and then you're the agent.
will be okay, like sort of, it's not project management.
but work with the teams, understand what is.
the status there, what they did, if they are doing it correctly.
review that, like, challenge them.
and lead the technical way for the teams and.
Since this team like the platform team
is responsible for the entire micro front-end architecture.
of live person, then it's not just the two teams that we have, but we
We also responsible on how everything works together.
Okay, so it has to be someone that...
is always aware of what
the guidelines we are communicating to the teams.
to all of the UI teams.
. .
. .
Yes.
So yeah, so that's what I'm looking for.
Uh, yeah, no, I'm okay.
I think I'm, I'm, I'm okay. Like, so from.
From a process perspective, I just.
to explain how it is working on hiring process.
then like this is like the hiring manager interview.
you what we did now, and then if you are.
If you pass this level, then you will be transitioned to
full loop interviews of several interviewers.
more technical interviews with students.
with another principle.
two team leads and and like so so on.
on, something like three more interviews to have.
So and then if everything goes okay, then you will get the contract and
and then you can start. By the way, what is your notice period?
Three months.
. .
Ah, not much.
we don't have many, yeah, there are, yes, we don't have many.
Very few. Okay.
I'm sorry.
It was very nice talking to you Mustafa, we will be in touch.
Dutch, or me or Marvin, the HR.
Yeah, and good luck with the process
Thank you. You too. Bye-bye.
