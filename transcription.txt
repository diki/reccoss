Let's design the front end for a simplified version of Instagram. We'll focus only on the front end.
Displaying a scrollable list of posts from users the current day.
current user follows. Posts. Each post will show an image. The username of the post will
a caption, the like count, and a preview of a few comments, liking.
Users should be able to like and unlike a post. The like count should update. Comments
Users should be able to see a list of comments for a post, perhaps by clicking view all
comments or similar, users should be able to add a new comment to a post.

Aaron, how are you?
All good. In office? No.
Okay. No worries. Thank you. Bye bye. Bye bye.
No, I mean, today I'm not in office, so yes, no, I'm not in office.
has changed today. So we in the morning, let's stay home.
me I was a bit, I don't know, I was not planning to work in the morning, but then a bug came and I ended up working.
working on the matrix.
Precis. Nej f√•r vi blir.
again, right? Do you have any topics? Let me share my screen. Yeah, let's start with the one on one, right?
topics.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
.
. .
I mean from the, yeah, so from the challenging part is the language or the
product.
.
.
. .
. .
Thank you for watching!
. .
Thank you.
You know, I understand that, right? See, for the web part, right, we will anyways come
But if you want, we can do one thing after we do the iOS, right?
We take a break, we go back to web, we can pick a few things on web and then come back to the ILS part.
Once we have someone else join us, I think the idea would be the same, right?
that we work across the tech stack, basically.
iOS, React Native, Android, and
web and web right basic which is JavaScript or TypeScript.
. .
. .
And what are the things that we can.
can do what you're saying.
Thank you.
Bye-bye.
. .
. .
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
. .
I agree.
No, I agree, I agree, Mustafa, I don't agree.
also help us right a smaller team it will also help us tomorrow to reduce to work on more features
the same time, right? My question is, would you want to pick this up as a side project in the sense that.
Maybe invest some time, one month.
. .
So what do you want to pick this up?
Exactly right. I mean what we can do is in a one on one.
we can go back and we don't make any commitments right now. The reason I don't want to make any commitments is because...
people really excited and then they think about, oh, tomorrow it will be delivered. I don't want to do that. Right.
more of a commitment between you and me but then
would have control to ask you what is the progress that you've made and then we actually spend time.
on this, what are the blockers and so on, so it becomes like a project between us.
We can also create.
No, I mean, I was thinking let's make some.
Uh, what I was thinking, OK. OK.
Let's look, yeah, I agree, I agree.
I mean, let's make a proof of concept.
Thank you.
I mean, I have read about this. It's one of the things that I would also love to solve.
My understanding is that it's not that easy. It looks easy, but it's not that easy.
I'll tell you where we are using it right now. Okay, we do have a cross platform.
from this thing, which is in the error codes, exactly.
It's the simplest part right because.
Exactly.
. .
You'll have to create coordinates.
mods across right or not even codemods right maybe even creating the mcp server.
vote should be fine. Maybe. I'm thinking maybe we can actually, maybe we can.
we can actually leverage AI into this rather than do it ourselves.
I mean.
. .
. .
Yeah, I think it's worth to try, right? And once we have a case for this, we will see you in the next one.
bring this week, not me, but once we work on this together, right? So you do the whole work.
Maybe I can help you create the project plan here, right, of how to, and even the presentation part, right?
help you with those little things and then maybe you present it to William or Petter as well and then you.
show that guys this is what would help us and I'm once we get to a point where it is that.
Then maybe it's the time to actually start. Do.
doing things around that part, because I also agree with you, right, but also another thing I would say.
right is you also need to be understand what all can be done.
Right, so for example, do we also plan to do it for security, I mean.
UI elements or some basic parts of code, for example, payment executor or is
There are more.
We can start with Payment Executor for now.
then we work our way, right? Let's take team into executor for this, right?
Thank you.
You
Bye.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
.
Okay, I'll assign this one to you. Now from our
side, we'll use our one-on-ones to track the progress.
All right, and I would say keep some time during the weeks right when maybe
like say two hours you can always keep saying okay I want to work on this one okay.
your calendar already, in fact.
Bye-bye.
So spend some time on this one and then it will help us as well right in future.
after you do this. So I would also say block yourself like one hour every week or two hours to go.
Just to be sure, because I don't think we can put a lot of time into it.
of time as well into this considering where we are right how we are working.
So I would say just be very careful about that, but let's make sure that for those one hour or two hours.
are working on it. Let's say two hours every week, right? I think it's four hours. Two hours every week should be enough.
So once you have that information, but just block your time in your calendar as well.
saying this is what I'm working on and then track the progress accordingly for yourself.
Alright. Amazing. Anything else on your list as well?
Okay, I have one.
I want to discuss is and it's more about the quality part right so I want to work on how.
I see you can do things really well in the sense you can.
You can take any complex topic. I don't have any problems that can take any complex topic you can.
Deliver it right? You've been working on this together. I really want to work on us together.
the weather is on the hour part, right? So the hygiene part of it basically.
What I mean here is one of the feedback that I want to give you is right now, for example, the payment button.
We talked about this, I've been raising this for past right and payment.
button be from the button separate, right? We've always said yes, yes, yes.
right. But we never really sat down and said, can you show
me how it is actually being done. Can you explain to me what exactly this is?
go to WebSDK and see what the actual implementation is, right? So these are the.
small small things right which then end up being in the end right so for example for payment button
I would, my way I would do it is, uh, if it's being asked too much times.
I would just create a separate ticket just to track that. Just to be safe.
Right, so I really want us to work towards a place where.
The things are more refined on how you're working. Right now, that's my understanding.
right. There are a lot of things and with you.
which is a good thing because you deliver a lot of things.
right? There's also a lot of trust here. What we really need to improve is, and that means...
to come from you is how you manage those things really well.
The way to do that is actually define it really well, right guys, this is what I'm supposed to do here.
exactly what will happen. In this case, the expectations are not.
Different. Right, even in and you really need to protect yourself in this case.
It just also helps you protect yourself saying, OK, I will deliver this. This is exactly things that.
I would deliver, which for me, I see this missing right now.
I see sometimes like tickets being created, which is.
a big ticket has small, small parts, then something gets lost.
somewhere and then it becomes a bit difficult or
I would say it becomes a bit...
But in the end, it becomes frustrating for you because you then have to go back and
So there's a lot of back and forth that can happen in the end just before we make the final thing.
So, that's one of the things I want to work with you.
polish it more, right? How do we make your work more polished in the sense?
it's there's less of things that are unfinished or there.
less things which are unrefined while they're happening. It's very raw, to be honest, when I look at it.
Bye-bye. Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
Thank you.
Yeah, I mean
Yeah, exactly. Right. I mean, I don't think you don't do it. I just think that, um, it
to be really clear to others as well, right? I mean.
And I really want to, because see Mustafa, again, like I said, I want you to grow more.
more right in this company or outside i don't i mean there's no matter right but
you to grow more, I really want in a way where you can take a project, break
it down into smaller parts in such a way that it's clearly everything is clearly there.
and anyone can come and pick this up.
And it's a way of working that we need to improve, right? And that's what I want to work with you because I was thinking about.
this right so what what I can put for you as a growth plan or together right that we need to work
Technically, you're doing everything, you're doing more, Mustafa, in fact, but this is one of the...
the places where you can improve actually.
I would predict this
I mean, I'm not putting anything here, but improve ways of working, right?
No, I will not even put weights on working.
I mean, let me just put dumb things in and then I'll explain what.
we can do here. Improve ways of working and let me just run and then because this.
comes out wrong. I mean your ways of working need to be improved.
It's not that right, but I want to I want to work with you in such a way that you.
