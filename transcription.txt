And then again for seven years. Does anyone...
Does anyone have any idea what the number one cause of death is in this country?
Shotgun weddings. That's not what that is. Fright. Being scared to death. No.
Obesity caused illnesses. Thank you. Holly is right. People, this is not...
just about winning some extra vacation days. This is about a very...
cool HR initiative that if we don't follow, we're all going to
to die of obesity. So how much are we going to lose? I would like to lose $65.
Yes! All right. Who else? Angela, can I put you down for a minute?
No. My doctor wants me to gain weight. If you gain weight, you will die. I want you to die.
I want you to live forever. I want us all to live forever. How? How are we gonna do this? Cryogenics.
Beer me five. This is how we're gonna do it. Five pounds. I'm asking each of you...
you to lose five pounds. That, plus Jim's 65, give us a very...
Very good chance at winning this thing. All right, I'm taking off.
Nope. Just going to see Pam. Maybe put up some shelves. Wait a second.
We don't want you to end up with a surprise pregnancy like me.
Okay, thank you for this. You want more? No.
I don't know if there's any one place that has all these things.
It's not my problem. A thousand-year-old church in the continental United States.
There has to be a rainbow 24-hour veterinarian on me.
That is very important to me, so I have work to do, just do it.
Sweetheart, just so you know, I don't care.
I don't care where we get married. I'll marry you right here in this building. I'll marry you in the park.
I'll marry you in the eye of a hurricane in the middle of a snowstorm.
on top of a monsoon.
All I care about is that we're gonna spend the rest of our lives together.
Eww.
I know I haven't made this easy on you.

Oh
Hi. Hi. Mmm.
Peace.
Oh, that's so rude of me. Have you seen, um, Pam's new art?
It's right there. Check it out.
Just when I've begun to get myself together...
That's a pretty lame party.
Does anyone want to dance?
오늘도 시청해주셔서 감사합니다
Some girl.
I came into Pam's room crying about her roommate stealing her soy milk, so...
I'm in here waiting it out. Stanley, Michael's not here. You can eat it later.
a slice of your birthday cake? I don't like cake anymore. Why not, dog?
Taste changed, and now all I like is baklava.
Michael, we have a situation.
