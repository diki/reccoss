automatically bumps you up a full letter grade. So.
I'd be stupid not to do it, right?
a teacher and I am like the cool teacher like Mr. Handel.
Mr. Handel would hang out with us, and he would tell us awesome jokes.
and he actually hooked up with one of the students, and then like
like 12 other kids came forward, it was in all the papers.
It really ruined eighth grade for us.
