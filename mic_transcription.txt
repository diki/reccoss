[2025-04-02 15:20:59] Now let's talk a little bit about the fact that we are a leader in the world and we should join together.
[2025-04-02 15:21:14] Okay, it's fine, it's fine, it's okay. Thank you. I'm gonna talk a little bit, I wanna make sure it's fine.
[2025-04-02 15:21:20] But as I said, of the company, we are roughly speaking around 700 employees at the moment.
[2025-04-02 15:21:24] Oh, okay. Quite a number, yeah.
[2025-04-02 15:21:29] Thank you.
[2025-04-02 15:21:34] And then next to them, we also have some in-products.
[2025-04-02 15:21:45] Okay, but I don't go into further detail because it's not relevant now for this role, okay?
[2025-04-02 15:21:46] I don't know why this could be too long, but what I meant to say is that we could all just fix the rules, but overall, it's a taste test.
[2025-04-02 15:21:51] They have a similar cool mission. Whatever we do, it always has to do with engaging the enemy.
